I wanted to be able to use the filament change feature of the marlin firmware (M600 gcode). But it currently requires a LCD panel which I don't have.

Since the `M108` gcode doesn't work correctly, I decided to add a push button used as an 'OK button' and modify the firmware to handle it.

The MKS Base 1.2 motherboard of the DiscoEasy200 has 2 free analog pins (A11 and A12): ![A11 and A12](/assets/img/project/mods/a11-and-a12.png)

By wiring a simple push button and a 10kÎ© pull-up resistor to A11 ![schematic](/assets/img/project/mods/schematic.png)
![final](/assets/img/project/mods/final.png)

you get a pin value set to HIGH when the button is not pressed, and to LOW when it is pressed.

Next we have to modify the firmware ....
