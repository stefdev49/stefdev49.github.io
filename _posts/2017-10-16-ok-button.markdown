I wanted to be able to use the filament change feature of the marlin firmware (M600 gcode). But it currently requires a LCD panel which I don't have.
<!--more-->
Since the `M108` gcode doesn't work correctly, I decided to add a push button used as an 'OK button' and modify the firmware to handle it.

The MKS Base 1.2 motherboard of the DiscoEasy200 has 2 free analog pins (A11 and A12): ![A11 and A12](/assets/img/project/mods/a11-and-a12.png)

By wiring a simple push button and a 10kÎ© pull-up resistor to A11 ![schematic](/assets/img/project/mods/schematic.png)
![final](/assets/img/project/mods/final.png)

you get a pin value set to HIGH when the button is not pressed, and to LOW when it is pressed.

The wiring can be tested with the `M43` gcode if the firmware is built with the following define in `Marlin/Configuration_adv.h` :
```c
#define PINS_DEBUGGING
```

Issuing `M43` dumps the pins status. When the button is not pressed we get :
```
M43
PIN:   0   Port: E0        RXD                         protected
PIN:   1   Port: E1        TXD                         protected
PIN:   2   Port: E4        CASE_LIGHT_PIN              protected
...............
PIN:  62   Port: K0 (A 8)  Z_ENABLE_PIN                protected
PIN:  63   Port: K1 (A 9)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =   923   Input  = 1  
PIN:  64   Port: K2 (A10)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =   769   Input  = 1  
PIN:  65   Port: K3 (A11)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =  1023   Input  = 1  
...............
PIN:  69   Port: K7 (A15)  TEMP_1_PIN                  Analog in =  1023  
ok P15 B3
```
So we have a high digital value when button is not pressed. The when we issue `M43` again with the button held down we have a 0 digital value :
```
M43
PIN:   0   Port: E0        RXD                         protected
PIN:   1   Port: E1        TXD                         protected
PIN:   2   Port: E4        CASE_LIGHT_PIN              protected
...............
PIN:  62   Port: K0 (A 8)  Z_ENABLE_PIN                protected
PIN:  63   Port: K1 (A 9)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =   922   Input  = 1  
PIN:  64   Port: K2 (A10)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =   769   Input  = 1  
PIN:  65   Port: K3 (A11)  <unused/unknown>   Analog in =     0   Input  = 0  
PIN:  66   Port: K4 (A12)  BEEPER_PIN                  Output = 0  
PIN:  67   Port: K5 (A13)  TEMP_0_PIN                  protected
PIN:  68   Port: K6 (A14)  TEMP_BED_PIN                protected
PIN:  69   Port: K7 (A15)  TEMP_1_PIN                  Analog in =  1023  
ok P15 B3

```

So the code to test button is pressed is as simple as :
```c
digitalRead(65) == LOW
```
