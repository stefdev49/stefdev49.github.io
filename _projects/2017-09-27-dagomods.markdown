#### DiscoEasy200 modifications and improvements
<div class="hline"></div>
Various mods of the DiscoEasy200.


#### OK Button
I wanted to be able to use the filament change feature of the marlin firmware (M600 gcode). But it currently requires a LCD panel which I don't have. Since the M108 gcode doesn't work correctly, I decided to add a push button used as an 'OK button' and modify the firmware to handle it.

The MKS Base 1.2 in the DiscoEasy200 has 2 free analog pins : ![A11 and A12](/assets/img/project/mods/a11-and-a12.png)

By wiring a simple push button and a 10k pull-up resistor to A11 ![schematic](/assets/img/project/mods/schematic.png)
![final](/assets/img/project/mods/final.png)

the pin value is set to HIGH when the button is not pressed, and to LOW when it is pressed.




But we also have to modify the firmware to take this button into account.
